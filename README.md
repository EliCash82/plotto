To learn more about Plotto check out this NPR segment from February 15, 2012 [HERE](/http://www.npr.org/2012/02/19/146941343/plotto-an-algebra-book-for-fiction-writing)

### Clause A

**The Protagonist Clause**

### Clause B

**Originates and Carries All Action**

### Clause C

**Carries On/Terminates Action**

### 3 Clauses

* Carry Plot from :: Introduction -> ascending action -> crisis -> denouement
  * Thus: `clause.a.1 + clause.b.1 + clause.c.1 = MASTERPLOT`
  


### Rules of the Game

* Any A clause may be used in conjunction with with any B clause and with any C clause

* Plotto conflicts :
  * listed in subgroups
  * each subgroup listed under full text of B Clause
    * Subgroup exemplifies B Clause

* Page following "Masterplot Pages"
  * UNDER : Parentheses number of the B Clause : IS THE : index of respective Conflict sub-groups


* The C (or TERMINAL) Clauses
  * numbered in Parenthesis
  * Conflicts suggesting these terminations found opposite C Clause numbers
    * In Classifications by symbols
